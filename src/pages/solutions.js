      No matter how much you love learning, or how prepared you feel before a
      class begins, there is often something you miss out on in class.
      Especially if the topic goes beyond your area of expertise. It’s difficult
      to get clarification on the spot because it’s not always easy to admit
      that you missed a key point - there’s fear of looking silly, and it
      usually requires more effort than just doing the thing and having it done
      with. Often this leads to going through an entire course without really
      understanding - and having to learn it again later when you encounter that
      same situation in a job environment, or when studying for an exam at a
      university. For some people, it leads to being crippled by doubt and
      uncertainty about whether they can cope with what comes next. Our
      educational platform, CESS, provides all students with 24/7 access to
      other students and course support from teachers across the nation. You can
      ask questions, get feedback on assessments, discuss relevant topics in
      virtual study groups, and find support from other students who are facing
      similar challenges.
